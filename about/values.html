                    <h1>Remember the human</h1>
                    <p>We believe Reddit is the most human place on the internet. It’s powered by the creativity,
                        passion, and generosity of the people who spend time here and make it their own. We respect
                        redditors and work hard to give them a place where self-expression can thrive and communities
                        can achieve amazing things together.</p><br>
                    <p>We also remember that there are real people on the other side of the screen who lead full and
                        complex lives. And often, when someone is struggling or in need of support, they come to Reddit
                        to find help and understanding they can’t find elsewhere. We take this role seriously and aim to
                        make Reddit a place where people can continue to find communities that accept and appreciate
                        them for who they are.</p>

                    <h1>Start with community</h1>
                    <p>Reddit succeeds when our communities succeed. When we build anything on Reddit, we start with
                        community—evaluating ideas by how well they empower communities.</p><br>
                    <p>Reddit has evolved by decentralizing control and empowering communities to create the spaces that
                        work for them—spaces that have become some of the most selfless, ingenuitive, funny, and
                        enriching communities on the internet. We trust communities to know what works best for them and
                        give them the autonomy to make decisions for themselves.</p>

                    <h1>Keep Reddit real</h1>
                    <p>Reddit is where people can be genuine. The humans of Reddit are a vast and diverse group of
                        people, who come to the platform as their full, imperfect, human selves. This results in the
                        type of candid, honest discussions you cannot have anywhere else and the vast breadth of
                        communities that are found on Reddit. We present an authentic, unmanicured version of the world,
                        and as long as being your unfiltered self is not hurting anyone or violating the Content Policy,
                        then there’s a place for you on Reddit.</p><br>
                    <p>We do not understand or agree with everything on Reddit (we are a vast and diverse group of
                        people, too), and we do not try to conform Reddit to what we or other people think it should be.
                        We do, though, try to create a space that is as real, complex, and wonderful as the world
                        itself.</p>

                    <h1>Privacy is a right</h1>
                    <p>Reddit stands for privacy. Redditors have complete control of their identity and are empowered to
                        share as much or as little personal information as they want. Redditors do not reveal
                        information about each other without permission, and Reddit does not use nonpublic information
                        about redditors without their consent.</p><br>
                    <p>We also let people know and control how we use their data. We run ads, and use what people agree
                        to share with us to show them ads we think they might be interested in (and yes, to make money)
                        but we don’t and won’t ever sell redditors’ personal information.</p>

                    <h1>Believe in the good</h1>
                    <p>Reddit reflects humanity. When people on Reddit come together around something they really care
                        about, they can and will do extraordinary things. In our interactions, we try to give each other
                        the benefit of the doubt and remember that most people—even when upset, frustrated, or
                        misguided—are decent and reasonable, and will do the right thing given the right circumstances.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Believing in the good does not mean disbelieving the bad. But we believe most people come to
                        Reddit because they genuinely want to contribute and feel a sense of belonging. If that is not
                        happening, something is wrong and we will fix it. People are good, and if we empower them, the
                        good will always outshine the bad.</p>
